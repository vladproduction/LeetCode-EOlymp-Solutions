Explanation:

(*)islandPerimeter Method:

Takes a 2D integer array grid representing the map.
Initializes perimeter to 0.
Iterates through each cell in the grid using nested loops.
If the current cell is land (grid[i][j] == 1), it calls cellPerimeter to calculate the perimeter for that cell and adds
it to the total perimeter.

(*)cellPerimeter Method:

Takes the grid, current row (row), column (col), total rows (rows), and total columns (cols) as arguments.
Initializes perimeter to 0.
Checks each neighbor (top, bottom, left, right) of the current cell.
If a neighbor is water (grid[row - 1][col] == 0 for top), it means that side contributes to the perimeter and increments perimeter.
Returns the calculated perimeter for the current land cell.

(*)How it Works:

The code iterates through each cell in the grid.
If a cell is land, it checks its adjacent cells (up, down, left, right).
If an adjacent cell is water, it means that side borders the water and contributes to the island's perimeter.
The cellPerimeter function calculates the total number of sides bordering water for a land cell.
Finally, the islandPerimeter method accumulates the perimeter for each land cell, giving the total perimeter of the island.
